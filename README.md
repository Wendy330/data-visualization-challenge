# data-visualization-challenge
This is a coding challenge of creating a data visualization project using d3.js.

#### Steps:
1. Read and parse the CSV file using JS to extract required data
2. Create a line-chart to present how the cancellation reasons compare over the year
3. Add unit tests (Really sorry about this, I had some difficulties of installing jest modules locally, so I just commented out my sudo test cases without running/passing them)

#### How to run this project:
No specific instructions.


#### Line Chart preview:
